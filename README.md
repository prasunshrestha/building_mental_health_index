# building_mental_health_index

We deployed regression models, using poverty, crime, unemployment, and suicide rate, to create a region-specific mental health index. The idea was to build an index that would serve as a preventive measure to policymakers and advocacy groups to assess and combat mental health issues. Similarly, we also created a user-friendly dashboard that visualized and allowed for comparisons of mental health status by states and/or by time.
